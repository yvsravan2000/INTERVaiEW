The platform tracks user sessions, orders, and product catalog changes. The business requires:\n\n- The ability to analyze user behavior over time, including session paths and conversion funnels.\n- Efficiently track product catalog changes, including price and attribute history, for compliance and analytics.\n- Support for querying both current and historical product data, with minimal performance impact.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nDesign a data model that supports these requirements, considering slowly changing dimensions (SCD), sessionization, and efficient querying. Provide:\n\na) The necessary table definitions (DDL) for user sessions, orders, and a product dimension that supports SCD Type 2.  \nb) An advanced SQL query that, for a given date range, reconstructs the full session path for each user and joins each order to the correct historical product attributes (as of the order time), using window functions or other advanced SQL features.\n\n---\n\n**Answer 1:**\n\n**a) Table Definitions (DDL):**\n\n```sql\n-- User Sessions Table\nCREATE TABLE user_sessions (\n    session_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id STRING,\n    session_start TIMESTAMP,\n    session_end TIMESTAMP,\n    session_sequence ARRAY<STRING> -- ordered list of page/event IDs\n);\n\n-- Orders Table\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id STRING,\n    session_id STRING,\n    order_time TIMESTAMP,\n    product_id STRING,\n    quantity INTEGER,\n    price_at_order NUMBER(10,2)\n);\n\n-- Product Dimension Table (SCD Type 2)\nCREATE TABLE dim_product (\n    product_sk NUMBER AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    product_id STRING,\n    product_name STRING,\n    category STRING,\n    price NUMBER(10,2),\n    attributes VARIANT,\n    valid_from TIMESTAMP,\n    valid_to TIMESTAMP,\n    is_current BOOLEAN\n);\n\n-- Index/Clustering for performance (optional, for large tables)\nCREATE TABLE orders CLUSTER BY (order_time);\nCREATE TABLE dim_product CLUSTER BY (product_id, valid_from);\n```\n\n**b) Advanced SQL Query:**\n\n_Reconstruct session paths and join orders to the correct historical product attributes as of the order time:_\n\n```sql\nWITH session_paths AS (\n    SELECT\n        s.user_id,\n        s.session_id,\n        s.session_start,\n        s.session_end,\n        s.session_sequence,\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.user_id ORDER BY s.session_start) AS session_num\n    FROM user_sessions s\n    WHERE s.session_start >= '2024-01-01' AND s.session_end < '2024-02-01'\n),\norders_with_product_history AS (\n    SELECT\n        o.order_id,\n        o.user_id,\n        o.session_id,\n        o.order_time,\n        o.product_id,\n        o.quantity,\n        o.price_at_order,\n        p.product_sk,\n        p.product_name,\n        p.category,\n        p.price AS product_price_at_order,\n        p.attributes\n    FROM orders o\n    JOIN dim_product p\n      ON o.product_id = p.product_id\n     AND o.order_time >= p.valid_from\n     AND o.order_time < COALESCE(p.valid_to, '9999-12-31')\n    WHERE o.order_time >= '2024-01-01' AND o.order_time < '2024-02-01'\n)\nSELECT\n    sp.user_id,\n    sp.session_id,\n    sp.session_num,\n    sp.session_start,\n    sp.session_end,\n    sp.session_sequence,\n    owph.order_id,\n    owph.order_time,\n    owph.product_id,\n    owph.product_name,\n    owph.category,\n    owph.product_price_at_order,\n    owph.attributes,\n    owph.quantity,\n    owph.price_at_order\nFROM session_paths sp\nLEFT JOIN orders_with_product_history owph\n  ON sp.session_id = owph.session_id\nORDER BY sp.user_id, sp.session_num, owph.order_time;\n```\n\n**Expert Notes:**\n\n- The `dim_product` table uses SCD Type 2 to track historical changes, with `valid_from`/`valid_to` and `is_current` for efficient point-in-time lookups.\n- The sessionization logic leverages arrays for ordered event tracking and window functions for session numbering.\n- The join between `orders` and `dim_product` ensures each order is matched to the correct product attributes as of the order time, using a range join on `valid_from`/`valid_to`.\n- Clustering keys are suggested for large tables to optimize query performance on time-based and product-based queries.", "**Question 2:**\n\nYou are tasked with designing a Snowflake data model for a SaaS analytics platform that supports multi-tenancy. Each tenant (customer) can define custom fields for their events, and the schema for these fields can evolve over time. The platform must:\n\n- Efficiently store and query event data with both standard and tenant-specific custom fields.\n- Support schema evolution without downtime or costly migrations.\n- Allow analytics queries that aggregate both standard and custom fields across tenants, while maintaining strong data isolation and performance.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nDesign a data model that supports these requirements, considering semi-structured data, schema-on-read, and multi-tenancy best practices. Provide:\n\na) The necessary table definition(s) (DDL) for storing events, including support for custom fields and schema evolution.  \nb) An advanced SQL query that, for a given tenant and date range, aggregates event counts by a standard field (e.g., event_type) and a custom field (whose name is provided at query time), using dynamic SQL or lateral flattening as appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Answer 2:**\n\n**a) Table Definition (DDL):**\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE events (\n    event_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,\n    tenant_id STRING,\n    event_time TIMESTAMP,\n    event_type STRING,\n    user_id STRING,\n    standard_fields OBJECT, -- for extensible standard fields\n    custom_fields VARIANT,  -- for tenant-defined custom fields (schema-on-read)\n    inserted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()\n)\nCLUSTER BY (tenant_id, event_time);\n```\n\n- `custom_fields` uses VARIANT to store arbitrary JSON, supporting schema evolution and tenant-specific fields.\n- Clustering by `tenant_id` and `event_time` optimizes multi-tenant and time-based queries.\n\n**b) Advanced SQL Query:**\n\n_Aggregate event counts by `event_type` and a dynamic custom field (e.g., \"campaign_id\") for a given tenant and date range:_\n\n```sql\n-- Assume :CUSTOM_FIELD_NAME is a bind variable or parameter (e.g., 'campaign_id')\n-- For static SQL, use a specific field name in the path (e.g., custom_fields:campaign_id)\n\nSELECT\n    event_type,\n    custom_fields[:CUSTOM_FIELD_NAME]::STRING AS custom_field_value,\n    COUNT(*) AS event_count\nFROM events\nWHERE tenant_id = :TENANT_ID\n  AND event_time >= :START_DATE\n  AND event_time < :END_DATE\nGROUP BY event_type, custom_fields[:CUSTOM_FIELD_NAME]::STRING\nORDER BY event_type, event_count DESC;\n```\n\n**If the custom field is nested or you want to flatten all custom fields:**\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    e.event_type,\n    f.key AS custom_field_name,\n    f.value::STRING AS custom_field_value,\n    COUNT(*) AS event_count\nFROM events e,\n     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => e.custom_fields) f\nWHERE e.tenant_id = :TENANT_ID\n  AND e.event_time >= :START_DATE\n  AND e.event_time < :END_DATE\n  AND f.key = :CUSTOM_FIELD_NAME\nGROUP BY e.event_type, f.key, f.value::STRING\nORDER BY e.event_type, event_count DESC;\n```\n\n**Expert Notes:**\n\n- Using VARIANT for `custom_fields` enables schema-on-read and seamless schema evolution.\n- LATERAL FLATTEN allows querying arbitrary or dynamic custom fields without schema changes.\n- Clustering by `tenant_id` and `event_time` ensures strong data isolation and efficient pruning.\n- This approach supports multi-tenancy, extensibility, and high-performance analytics without costly migrations.", "**Question 3:**\n\nYou are architecting a Snowflake data warehouse for a financial services company that must support complex regulatory reporting. The requirements include:\n\n- Tracking account balances and transactions with full auditability (i.e., every change must be traceable).\n- Supporting point-in-time reporting (e.g., reconstructing all account balances as of any historical date).\n- Efficiently handling high transaction volumes and minimizing storage costs, while ensuring query performance for both current and historical data.\n\n**Scenario:**  \nDesign a data model that supports these requirements, considering data versioning, partitioning/clustering, and auditability. Provide:\n\na) The necessary table definitions (DDL) for accounts, transactions, and a balance history table that supports point-in-time queries and audit trails.  \nb) An advanced SQL query that, for a given date, reconstructs the full account balance sheet as of that date, using window functions or other advanced SQL features to ensure accuracy and performance.\n\n---\n\n**Answer 3:**\n\n**a) Table Definitions (DDL):**\n\n```sql\n-- Accounts Table\nCREATE TABLE accounts (\n    account_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,\n    account_holder STRING,\n    account_type STRING,\n    opened_date DATE,\n    closed_date DATE\n);\n\n-- Transactions Table (immutable, fully auditable)\nCREATE TABLE transactions (\n    transaction_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,\n    account_id STRING,\n    transaction_time TIMESTAMP,\n    amount NUMBER(18,2),\n    transaction_type STRING, -- e.g., 'DEPOSIT', 'WITHDRAWAL'\n    description STRING,\n    inserted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()\n)\nCLUSTER BY (account_id, transaction_time);\n\n-- Balance History Table (SCD Type 2 for auditability)\nCREATE TABLE account_balance_history (\n    account_id STRING,\n    balance_as_of TIMESTAMP,\n    balance NUMBER(18,2),\n    valid_from TIMESTAMP,\n    valid_to TIMESTAMP,\n    is_current BOOLEAN,\n    PRIMARY KEY (account_id, valid_from)\n)\nCLUSTER BY (account_id, valid_from);\n```\n\n- `transactions` is append-only for full auditability.\n- `account_balance_history` tracks balance changes over time, supporting SCD Type 2 for point-in-time and audit queries.\n- Clustering by `account_id` and time fields optimizes historical lookups.\n\n**b) Advanced SQL Query:**\n\n_Reconstruct the full account balance sheet as of a given date (e.g., '2024-03-31 23:59:59'):_\n\n```sql\nWITH latest_balance AS (\n    SELECT\n        ab.account_id,\n        ab.balance,\n        ab.valid_from,\n        ab.valid_to,\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (\n            PARTITION BY ab.account_id\n            ORDER BY ab.valid_from DESC\n        ) AS rn\n    FROM account_balance_history ab\n    WHERE ab.valid_from <= '2024-03-31 23:59:59'\n      AND (ab.valid_to > '2024-03-31 23:59:59' OR ab.valid_to IS NULL)\n)\nSELECT\n    a.account_id,\n    a.account_holder,\n    a.account_type,\n    lb.balance AS balance_as_of_2024_03_31\nFROM accounts a\nLEFT JOIN latest_balance lb\n  ON a.account_id = lb.account_id AND lb.rn = 1\nWHERE (a.closed_date IS NULL OR a.closed_date > '2024-03-31')\nORDER BY a.account_id;\n```\n\n**Expert Notes:**\n\n- The `account_balance_history` table enables efficient point-in-time queries and full audit trails.\n- The query uses a window function to select the latest valid balance record for each account as of the target date.\n- Clustering ensures that queries for a specific date and account are highly performant, even at scale.\n- This design supports both current and historical reporting, regulatory compliance, and minimizes storage by only recording balance changes."], "response_time_in_seconds": [2, 8, 7, 6], "total_tokens": [592, 1556, 2316, 3120]}
